# Iphone-App
Basic App with Login and Signup built on Xcode
I built this app to test out firebase. In order to use it you'll have to add your own info.plist, the Google services plist from your firebase page and add a podfile.
Because I've had to remove all the plist files I would suggest that you copy all the main files like the main.storyboard and paste them into your project. Once that's done all you have to do is follow the procedure of connecting your Firebase account to the project.
